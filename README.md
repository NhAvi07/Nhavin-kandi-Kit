# Nhavin-kandi-Kit
24-Hour-AI-Challenge - Fake news detection
As part of my 24 Hour AI Challenge submission, I choose to submit my working solution as a kandi kit. 
This will help the judges understand and evaluate my solution as well as help me showcase the solution.
Before I start making the submission kit, I ensure that I have completed my solution, and my solution repository is uploaded to GitHub.
